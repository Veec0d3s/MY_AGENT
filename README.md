## Cultural AI Assistant and Story Telling agent

## üåç Overview  
My project is an AI assistant trained on Ugandan legends, sayings, and short stories.  
It allows users to explore traditional stories, learn moral lessons, and understand sayings with translations and cultural context.  

## Why this project  
Uganda has a rich oral tradition, but many legends and sayings risk being forgotten. This is because of the new wave of technology which leaves no time for parents to sit down with their children to pass on some of these traditions. With the amount of time i have taken to compile these stories, it goes to show the need for a hub that has them availed. The agent can be used to better understand them, simplify them for students having a hard time as well as to provide knowledge for anyone who is just curious.

This project aims to preserve cultural wisdom in a digital form, making it accessible for future generations, students, and anyone interested in Luganda heritage.
